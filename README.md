## Project Goals
- Build a responsive and user-friendly interface inspired by Airbnb.
- Implement authentication (sign up, login, logout).
- Allow users to create, view, and book property listings.
- Practice modern web development workflows and deployment.

## Technology Stack

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for handling API requests between frontend and backend.  

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.  
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for Node.js, used to build RESTful APIs.  

### Database
