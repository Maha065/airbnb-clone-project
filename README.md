## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of **Airbnb**, built to practice and showcase full-stack web development skills.  
The goal is to replicate core features of Airbnb, such as browsing listings, viewing property details, user authentication, and booking functionality.

## Project Goals
- Build a responsive and user-friendly interface inspired by Airbnb.
- Implement authentication (sign up, login, logout).
- Allow users to create, view, and book property listings.
- Practice modern web development workflows and deployment.
